My Project Euler solutions https://projecteuler.net/

Each problem is compiled and run individually using `cargo script` (https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script).

To add dependencies to a script, the first line must be a single-line comment of the form:

```
// cargo-deps: num-traits = "0.2.11", num-bigint = "0.2.6"
```
